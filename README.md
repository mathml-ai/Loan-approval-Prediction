# Loan-approval-Prediction
This project is based on approving loan of the customers asking for it. The project explores various ML moels for the classification task based on the dataset distribution. 

The data is non-linearl and XGBoost and Random Forest came out as a perfect fit. 
It was a small size data. 
1) Performed indepth exploratory data analysis to find out the best features and create strong new features out of them. Used statistical tests to confirm our assertion.
2) Started with Logistic regression. Poor performance prooved data is not linearly seperable
3) Tried advanced classification algorithm, XGBoost and RandomForest to get the desired results.
4) Handled class imbalance using stratify split and class weight pos in XGB model
5) Used PR curve to confirm results. and Cross Validation to ensure absence of overfitting
